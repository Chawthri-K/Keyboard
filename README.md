Hello! Welcome to my DIY Keyboard Project!
The end goal for this project is to create a keyboard that looks like one of those old school typewriters. I've attached an image of a commericially available version, just to get an idea of what it might look like. <br />

Progress thus far:
Unfortunately I don't have all the skills necessary to build my ideal keyboard... yet.
Most of the skills I'll need to learn will relate to machining, including learning of to machine metal, how to use a CNC mill, and how to build a piece that uses both metal and wood. There were also some basic arduino skills that I already have that i would need to use to program the microcontroller (ATMEGA 32U4). The switches are arranged in a matrix, which allows hundreds of keys to be used as inputs, without requiring the IC to have 100s of digital in pins.

At the moment, Version 1.0 is complete. The only thing that was custom built on this keyboard was the actually wooden enclosure, which required the use of a mill, band saw, planar, electric drill, and taking basic measurements with a caliper.

I initially planned to design a board for it... and I did (files are in this repo), but I quickly realized that i had know way to guarantee that my design would work. Considering the fact that printing the board would be pretty expensive, I decided I should make a proof of concept board instead (with only four keys).  At the moment I haven't assembled it, tested it, or wrote the code, but the board itself has been designed and printed.

Continuing on with the V1.0. The entire board is completely assembled, it required all the machining skills I mentioned above, as well some basic THT soldering for the switches.

Above is the fully assembled V1.0 keyboard. The switches, PCB, and keycaps were all purchased online, and the wooden enclosure was milled by me from cedar wood. As stated above, the final iteration of the keyboard will look similar to a typewriter, and everything will be designed and manufactured by me, apart from the actual switches themselves. My next steps are to test out my 4 button proof of concept, so I can make changes as necessary, and build V2.0 using my own custom PCB and software.
